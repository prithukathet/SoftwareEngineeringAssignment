# Fermat's Last Theorem Near Misses Program

## Description
This program finds "near misses" for Fermat's Last 
Theorem in the form of the equation `x^n + y^n = z^n`, where `n > 2`. The program calculates small differences (near misses) between `x^n + y^n` and `z^n` and displays the smallest relative miss.

## How to Run the Program
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

git clone 
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or eclipse.
3. Compile and run the program from the `FermatTheoremNearMisses` class or run using the executable jar file. 
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to input values for `n` and `k`.
