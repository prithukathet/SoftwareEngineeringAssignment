# Fermat's Last Theorem Near Misses Program

## Description
This program finds "near misses" for Fermat's Last 
Theorem in the form of the equation `x^n + y^n = z^n`, where `n > 2`. The program calculates small differences (near misses) between `x^n + y^n` and `z^n` and displays the smallest relative miss.

## How to Run the Program
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
